The bot has to leave the channel before playing other songs or so. (Solving this problem is important - If anyone wants to make a contribution in music bot, please solve this issue before anything else).

(For now , the bot automatically leaves the channel once it finishes playing an audio.)

When everybody leaves voice channel , the bot automatically leaves.

Send apt messages . Eg : When nobody is there in voice channel , send  "Must be connected to voice channel to start playing audio" , etc
